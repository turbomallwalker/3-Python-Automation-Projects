This code makes an API request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for a specified city. It does the following:

Imports the requests library to make API calls
Stores the API key in a variable
Defines the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint
Gets a city name input from the user
Builds the API request URL with the city name and API key
Makes the API request and stores the response
Checks if the API request was successful (response code 200)
If successful, extracts the weather description and temperature in Kelvin from the JSON response
Converts the temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit
Prints the weather description and temperature in Fahrenheit
If the API request fails, prints an error message
So in summary, it allows the user to input a city, makes an API call to get the weather data, extracts the relevant info, converts units, and prints the results. The comments explain what each section of code is doing.
